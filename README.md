Predictive Modeling for Sleep Disorder Diagnosis

Overview
This project is a machine learning initiative aimed at analyzing health and lifestyle data to predict sleep disorders. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that can classify individuals as having Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, or no sleep disorder based on key health and lifestyle factors.

Key Features & Findings

Predictive Analysis: The core of this project is a machine learning model designed to classify sleep disorders.


Dataset: The analysis uses a dataset that includes health and lifestyle information.


Data-Driven Insights: The project investigates key factors such as sleep duration, stress levels, physical activity, and occupation.


High-Performing Model: The Random Forest model achieved a high F1-score of over 95% after hyperparameter tuning, indicating strong predictive performance.


Prognostic Value: The analysis highlights systolic and diastolic blood pressure as important predictors of sleep disorders.
